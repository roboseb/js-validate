Not gonna make much of a README here. Just came to say this was theoretically a simple little project, and that regex is a damn nightmare RIGHT until the moment it works, where you immediately make a mess of your pants.

I'm already caving in and adding a todo. Mostly style though, have a couple neat ideas to make something this small worthy of a portfolio.

Nearing the end. Pretty happy with the overall styling, and I think I'm scrapping the mouse position image morphing thing. Would be a fun standalone project. For now, just gotta clean up the image transitions and this is done. Img.src is stupid.

---To-Do---

DONE-make validatin header transition from top to side depending on screen width
DONE (Backdrop changes)-Add message for correct form
DONE-desktop media query
HARD CANCEL-Maaaayyybe make the backdrop shift depending on cursor location.
DONE-custom font

Not gonna make much of a README here. Just came to say this was theoretically a simple little project, and that regex is a damn nightmare RIGHT until the moment it works, where you immediately make a mess of your pants.

I'm already caving in and adding a todo. Mostly style though, have a couple neat ideas to make something this small worthy of a portfolio.


---To-Do---

-make validate transition from top to side depending on screen width
-Add message for correct form
-desktop media query
-Maaaayyybe make the backdrop shift depending on cursor location.
-custom font
